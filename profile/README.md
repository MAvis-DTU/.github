During the research evaluation of DTU in 2023 the research group was tasked to create a demonstration showcasing a more informal site of what we do at DTU. The repository contains code for a chatbot-setup with our Pepper robots. It takes a camera feed utilising a RealSense depth-camera, and connects to the OpenAI gpt models to create chat features and gestures during chatting. It has a UI that displays the camera feed and the chat side-by-side as the chat progresses.
